# 💻 Bayesian Neural Net
The following notebooks contain code for creating basic Bayesian Neural Networks.
## 👨‍💻 Code
The notebooks are divided in sections, including: 
1) Theory overview
2) Code snippets with commentaries
   * Networks setup
   * Data setup
   * Training
   * Evaluating
## 📈 Models used
### ♟ Net architecture
Two small models are implemented in every notebook with one architecture utilizing Multi-Layer Perceptrons and the second one with
convolutional layers.
### 🎲 Bayesian inference
To approximate posterior distribution, two methods of approximating were used:
1) Variational Inference
2) Markov Chain Monte Carlo
